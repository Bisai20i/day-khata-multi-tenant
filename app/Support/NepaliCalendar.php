 * Pure, dependency-free Gregorian (AD) <-> Bikram Sambat (BS) date conversion.

 * `../day_khata/app/Models/Nepali_Calendar.php`). Legacy walked the calendar
 * one day at a time from a fixed epoch, incrementing a Nepali (or English)
 * date every iteration; this class keeps legacy's day-count table and epoch
 * anchor verbatim but sums whole years/months instead of iterating day by
 * day, which is mathematically equivalent (verified against legacy's own
 * algorithm across the full supported range before this class was written)
 * and avoids tens of thousands of loop iterations for a single conversion.
 *
 * Epoch anchor: BS 2000-01-01 == AD 1943-04-14 (the same anchor legacy's
 * `nep_to_eng()` uses).
